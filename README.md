## Running the solution
1. Run the API *HarbourControlAPI*
    * The API uses in-memory data storage to store all vessel information
1. Run console application *HarbourVesselService*
    * This handles the creation and docking of vessels in the harbour
1. Run the web application *DurbanHarbourControlServices*
    * This has a visual indicator showing where the vessels are in relation to the port
